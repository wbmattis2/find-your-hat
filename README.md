# Find Your Hat 

Simple game for the Node CLI developed by Benny Mattis to specifications provided in a Codecademy project  

## How to Use  

Run index.js in [Node]([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/](https://nodejs.org/en)). Follow the prompts in your command line interface, and answer them by typing your responses and pressing ENTER.  

## Object of the Game  

The object of the game is to move your character (`*`) through the maze to find the hat (`^`) without falling in any holes (`O`). Traverse a space on the game board by entering a cardinal direction (N, S, E, or W). Be careful which direction you choose, because backtracking is not allowed!
